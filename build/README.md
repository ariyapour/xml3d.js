Folder: build/
========

This folder contains the closure compiler required for the minified versions of xml3d.js. Additionally, all builds of xml3d.js will end up in the sub-folder `output`.

To run the build script, just execute:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will install all dependencies. In the following, just run grunt from the commandline or from your favourite IDE:
```bash
grunt
```

This will build a development snapshot. For more available tasks, run:
```bash
grunt --help
```
